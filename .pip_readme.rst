Differentiable and accelerated wavelet transform on the sphere
=================================================================================================================

`S2WAV` is a python package for computing wavelet transforms on the sphere
and rotation group, both in JAX and PyTorch. It leverages autodiff to provide differentiable
transforms, which are also deployable on modern hardware accelerators
(e.g. GPUs and TPUs), and can be mapped across multiple accelerators.

More specifically, `S2WAV` provides support for scale-discretised
wavelet transforms on the sphere and rotation group (for both real and
complex signals), with support for adjoints where needed, and comes with
a variety of different optimisations (e.g. precompute or not,
multi-resolution algorithms) that one may select depending on available
resources and desired angular resolution $L$. `S2WAV` is a sister package of 
`S2FFT <https://github.com/astro-informatics/s2fft>`_, both of which are part of the `SAX` 
project, which aims to provide comprehensive support for differentiable transforms on the 
sphere and rotation group.
